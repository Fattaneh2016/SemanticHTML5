    A motor vehicle has a <dfn id="vin">
    <abbr title="Vehicle Identification Number">VIN</abbr></dfn>
    that is unique. Over the years, the 
    <abbr title="Vehicle Identification Number">VIN</abbr>
    has had different formats, 
    based on the vehicle manufacturer. 
</p>
<p>
    In the United States, the <a href="#vin">
    <abbr title="Vehicle Identification Number">VIN</abbr></a>
    was standardized to a 17 character format where 
    the 10th character of the
    <abbr title="Vehicle Identification Number">VIN</abbr>
    represents the year of the vehicle.
